# Why?
I wanted to know when a particular classroom is free so that I can go use the blackboard there

# Howw?
Given a timetable.pdf from the Timetable Division of BITS Hyderabad, we get information of all the classes, where they happen, and when they happen. 
So, using the tabula library to import the tables and pandas library to manipulate this data, I made a bunch of spreadsheets that show this information.
